    how do we add texts?

      Texts are written in two format
      1. Headings ; To add a heading use <h1> , <h2> , <h3> , <h4> , <h5>  , <h6>

               There are 6 different levels of headings starting from <h1> to <h6>.
               The number within a heading tag represents that heading’s level. 
               The largest and most important heading is h1, 
               while h6 is the tiniest heading at the lowest level.

      2. Paragraphs ; To add a paragraph use <p> 
    
    -->

    <h1> Hello</h1>

    <h6> Hello </h6>



    <!-- <br> is known as line break tag ; it is used to add line break creates a line break in a block of text. forcing the text after the <br> tag to start a new line and go below it  -->

        The <hr> tag in HTML is used to give a thematic break between paragraphs on a webpage. 
        It draws a horizontal line between paragraphs. It is also called a horizontal rule in HTML.

    <!--  
          To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element,
          it embeds an image into the page using a src attribute
          which tells the browser where the image file is located. 

          the alt attribute is known as alternate message, 
          it is used to display a piece of text that will be shown to the end user if the website is unsable to fetch the image. 


          within the src we can add two types of image links 

          Absolute links : Links to pages on other websites on the internet ; 
          
          <img src="https://www.keyweo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/google-logo-history.jpg"
          alt="google">

          Relative links : Links to pages located on our own websites ;
          
          <img src="/Images/anno4.jpg" alt="Anno"> is a relative link
          that points to a file in the same folder as the page where the link appears which Uses a forward slash to indicate the path to a file or folder on the same website

    <!-- 
         To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element.
         An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an <a> tag. 
         Inside the opening <a> tag we need to add an href (hypertext reference) attribute 
         to the opening anchor tag. The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to.

         How do we create a form in HTML?
         The form element is a container element like the div element
         we learned earlier in the curriculum. The form element wraps all of the inputs a user will interact with on a form.
         The form element accepts two essential attributes; action attribute which takes a URL value that tells the form where it should send its data to be processed. 
         The second is the method attribute which tells the browser which HTTP request method it should use to submit the form.
         The GET and POST request methods are the two you will find yourself using the most.

         Use the <form> </form> tags to create a formm in HTML and inside the form element we use <input> tags to create input fields and the 
         input tag accepts a type attribute which tells the browser what type of data it should expect and how it should render the input element.
         inside an input tag we add type attribute which tells the browser what type of data it should expect and how it should render the input element.

         We have different types of input types : The first being the text input, which is written as type ="text"

         <input type ="text" name="name" id="Username">

         Text inputs accept any text input. For example, you would use it to collect things like users’ first and last names.

         2. Email inputs are specialized text inputs just for email addresses. type ="email"
         3. Password inputs are another specialized text input. type ="password"
            They differ from regular text inputs in that they mask the inputted data with another character
            – usually an asterisk (*) or bullet point (•) – to prevent anyone from seeing what has been entered.
            Speacialy meant for creating input fields for passwords
         4. The number input only accepts number values and ignores any other characters the user tries to enter. type ="number"
         5. To collect dates from a user, we can use a date input.
            This input is unique because it provides a better user experience for choosing dates by rendering a date picker calendar.
         6. To create a checkbox we use the input element with a type attribute of “checkbox” 
            they allow users to choose from a set of predefined options. like a agreeing to Terms & Conditions. type ="checkbox"
         7. Both date and time combined : type="datetime-local"
         8. only time : type="time"
         9. Radio buttons : it is the same as checkboxes but When we select one of the radio buttons and then select another, 
            it will deselect the first one. Radio buttons know to do this because they have the same name attribute.
            specifically used for the gender selection option in sign up pages in website
         10. To add a color selector use the type ="color"

    <form>


        <label for="Username">Username</label> <!-- For adding a label/caption for a form elements, 
        
        The for attribute is used to associate a label with the form element. The value for the for attribute is set as the id of the form element which is Username
        so when we click label also focuses on the input field. -->
<input type="text" name="" id="Username" required> <!-- The required attribute : so when we add a required attribute to the input field
        we cant leave it blank and then hit the submit button, if we do so we will get a error saying that "please fill out the field"
        -->

<input type="submit">
<br>
<input type="password" name="" id="pass" minlength="7" maxlength="11" required> <!-- You can set the minimum lenght and maximum length required to the input by adding
        minlength=""  maxlength="" , in the attr value place the reuired characteres
        -->

        to restrict the file type use the accept attr and in the value insert the type of file you're expecting like .svg -->

    <!--
         To show a string of texts that will be used to guide users on what to enter in form elements, we use placeholder attribute to an input tag 
         The value will be the placeholder text we want to display in the input:  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Your name"> ;
         simple funda of the placeholder attribute is " jab tak koi data nhi dalta tab tak place ko hold karte raho "

    <!-- 
         To embed a video in your web page use the <video> </video> tag , the video tag works the same as image tag <img> 
         It uses the same src attribute like <img> which tells the browser where the image file is located. the src takes the same value relative link and absolute link 
     

         written like this : 
         <video src=""></video>

         the <video> tag will not work alone even if you add the video location in the src 
         to make it work use the autoplay attribute.

         Even after adding the autoplay attribute the video will play for a certain time and stop because you didn't mentioned that the video should play continiously 
         to fix this add a loop attribute. 

         Then to add control buttons so that you can mute pause, replay, expand, download, video timeline , playback speed, use the controls attribute 
         and to mute the video when the webpage gets loaded you can use the muted attribute :


         <video autoplay loop controls muted src="/Vidsbitch/8f8a961c3b6d74b119982c00bf01f67a.mp4">HTML </video>

         The <div> (division) element is a generic block-level element 
         that is typically used to separate page content into blocks to contain for HTML elements,
         which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. 

         The div tag in HTML is used to divide web page content into sections, 
         such as headers, footers, and navigations.
        Common uses for divs include grouping similar text, pictures, headers, and links.
